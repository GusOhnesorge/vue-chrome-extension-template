# Vue 3 Chrome Extension Template

This is a template for quickly building a Chrome extension with Vue 3.

It uses [CRXJS](https://crxjs.dev/vite-plugin/) to build the extension, and Vite to build the Vue app. HMR comes auto-enabled.

There are plans to add support for TypeScript and common UI libraries like Tailwind, DaisyUI, and UnoCSS.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo and clone it locally
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
4. Upload the `dist` folder to the Chrome extension dashboard as an unpacked extension
5. Pin the extension to your browser's toolbar for easy access
6. Click the extension icon to see the sidebar appear!
